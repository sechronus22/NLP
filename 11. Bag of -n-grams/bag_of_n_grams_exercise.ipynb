The sketch featured Alex Moffat as host Joe Scarborough and Kate McKinnon as Mika Mika Brzezinski. The sketch also has Alec Baldwin as President Donald Trump, who calls into the show as  John Miller,  a spokesperson for the White House. Back in the day, Trump was known for calling reporters all over the New York area pretending to be his own publicist. He would call, not to tout his business successes but to brag about his sex life.The sketch also made fun of the relationship between the hosts. The pair got engaged recently when they were celebrating Mika s 50th birthday. The sketch shows the response from the other panelists on the show, Mark Halperin, Willie Geist and Mike Barnacle, who all have no idea how to respond to Joe and Mika s behavior on the set.Featured image via Frederick M.

In the aftermath of the disastrous Comey hearing where it was confirmed that The Donald s team was indeed being investigated   and of Rep. Nunes  decision to skip informing his fellow congressional Russia investigators of perfectly legal  incidental collection  of information about Trump associates and possibly the President* himself and run to The Donald with it instead   Trump has been flailing, attempting to distract from the whole Russia thing as much as possible.That s going to be very hard now, as U.S. officials have now confirmed that the facts suggest that members of his team were indeed working with the enemy. CNN reports:The FBI has information that indicates associates of President Donald Trump communicated with suspected Russian operatives to possibly coordinate the release of information damaging to Hillary Clinton s campaign, US officials told CNN.\",\n          \" Vladimir Putin Just Defended Trump In The WORST Way Possible (VIDEO) According to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, it s silly to worry about little things like whether or not a couple of Russian ladies peed on Donald Trump s bed because it s much, much worse to publish memos that reveal these allegations.Putin says that there is a conspiracy to  delegitimize  the man and his team of hackers, fake news writers, and trolls he worked hard to install in the Oval Office by hacking Trump s political opponents and running an aggressive propaganda campaign. I don t know Mr. Trump, I have never met him, I don t know what he will do in the international arena, so I have no reason either to attack him, criticize him or defend him, Putin said at a press conference. Donald Trump has been with the most beautiful women in the world, so why would he need prostitutes in Moscow? To answer that question, we need only look to a 2001 edition of the Howard Stern Show in which Trump was reminded that he bragged that he likes to go to Russia to have sex with women because they  have no morals. Putin says that Russian security services  do not chase every US billionaire,  and that the release of the documents was worse than prostitutes. In a way, he s right, as the documents presented to both Trump and President Obama also allege that members of the President-elect s campaign staff directly worked with the Russian government during the campaign.On numerous occasions, Trump has repeated Russian propaganda while attacking U.S. intelligence agencies that have been exposing him for what he is and, of course, has directly quoted Putin (a man whom Trump says is  very smart ) while hurling barbs at Hillary Clinton.Trump and Putin have been screaming about the  fake news  release of actual documents that actual intelligence agencies are in possession of, but the BBC reported recently that the whole pissing Russian ladies thing is just the tip of the iceberg. Correspondent Paul Wood revealed last week that at least four sources have confirmed the information, with one U.S. intelligence source informing him that there is audio and video of The Donald s escapades, and an Israeli news source reports that the country s spies have been warned against sharing information with the United States for fear that Trump will relay it to Putin.Putin and Trump s bromance is disconcerting at best   especially when more than a baker s dozen intelligence agencies have confirmed that the man who stood up to join Trump in his attacks on our intelligence agencies has been confirmed to have interfered in our election.Watch it below:Featured image via Getty Images\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Real\",\n          \"Fake\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}],"source":["#import pandas library\n","import pandas as pd\n","#read the dataset with name \"Fake_Real_Data.csv\" and store it in a variable df\n","df = pd.read_csv('Fake_Real_Data.csv')\n","\n","\n","#print the shape of dataframe\n","print(df.shape)\n","\n","#print top 5 rows\n","df.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":178},"id":"N59dp0n1v_XU","outputId":"dd555357-8f41-47ff-bf34-c7b1ff68f52e","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746690007559,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":38,"user":{"displayName":"Worawit Jitpakdeebodin","userId":"15034424775479659108"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["label\n","Fake    5000\n","Real    4900\n","Name: count, dtype: int64"],"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>count</th>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>label</th>\n","      <th></th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Fake</th>\n","      <td>5000</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Real</th>\n","      <td>4900</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div><br><label><b>dtype:</b> int64</label>"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}],"source":["#check the distribution of labels\n","df.label.value_counts()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"Zr-vBY7xv_a3","outputId":"8b474c2e-06d0-4b11-87c9-c8ad8b1b4476","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746690186161,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":282,"user":{"displayName":"Worawit Jitpakdeebodin","userId":"15034424775479659108"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                Text label  labe_num  \\\n","0   Top Trump Surrogate BRUTALLY Stabs Him In The...

The sketch featured Alex Moffat as host Joe Scarborough and Kate McKinnon as Mika Mika Brzezinski. The sketch also has Alec Baldwin as President Donald Trump, who calls into the show as  John Miller,  a spokesperson for the White House. Back in the day, Trump was known for calling reporters all over the New York area pretending to be his own publicist. He would call, not to tout his business successes but to brag about his sex life.The sketch also made fun of the relationship between the hosts. The pair got engaged recently when they were celebrating Mika s 50th birthday. The sketch shows the response from the other panelists on the show, Mark Halperin, Willie Geist and Mike Barnacle, who all have no idea how to respond to Joe and Mika s behavior on the set.Featured image via Frederick M.

In the aftermath of the disastrous Comey hearing where it was confirmed that The Donald s team was indeed being investigated   and of Rep. Nunes  decision to skip informing his fellow congressional Russia investigators of perfectly legal  incidental collection  of information about Trump associates and possibly the President* himself and run to The Donald with it instead   Trump has been flailing, attempting to distract from the whole Russia thing as much as possible.That s going to be very hard now, as U.S. officials have now confirmed that the facts suggest that members of his team were indeed working with the enemy. CNN reports:The FBI has information that indicates associates of President Donald Trump communicated with suspected Russian operatives to possibly coordinate the release of information damaging to Hillary Clinton s campaign, US officials told CNN.\",\n          \" Vladimir Putin Just Defended Trump In The WORST Way Possible (VIDEO) According to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, it s silly to worry about little things like whether or not a couple of Russian ladies peed on Donald Trump s bed because it s much, much worse to publish memos that reveal these allegations.Putin says that there is a conspiracy to  delegitimize  the man and his team of hackers, fake news writers, and trolls he worked hard to install in the Oval Office by hacking Trump s political opponents and running an aggressive propaganda campaign. I don t know Mr. Trump, I have never met him, I don t know what he will do in the international arena, so I have no reason either to attack him, criticize him or defend him, Putin said at a press conference. Donald Trump has been with the most beautiful women in the world, so why would he need prostitutes in Moscow? To answer that question, we need only look to a 2001 edition of the Howard Stern Show in which Trump was reminded that he bragged that he likes to go to Russia to have sex with women because they  have no morals. Putin says that Russian security services  do not chase every US billionaire,  and that the release of the documents was worse than prostitutes. In a way, he s right, as the documents presented to both Trump and President Obama also allege that members of the President-elect s campaign staff directly worked with the Russian government during the campaign.On numerous occasions, Trump has repeated Russian propaganda while attacking U.S. intelligence agencies that have been exposing him for what he is and, of course, has directly quoted Putin (a man whom Trump says is  very smart ) while hurling barbs at Hillary Clinton.Trump and Putin have been screaming about the  fake news  release of actual documents that actual intelligence agencies are in possession of, but the BBC reported recently that the whole pissing Russian ladies thing is just the tip of the iceberg. Correspondent Paul Wood revealed last week that at least four sources have confirmed the information, with one U.S. intelligence source informing him that there is audio and video of The Donald s escapades, and an Israeli news source reports that the country s spies have been warned against sharing information with the United States for fear that Trump will relay it to Putin.Putin and Trump s bromance is disconcerting at best   especially when more than a baker s dozen intelligence agencies have confirmed that the man who stood up to join Trump in his attacks on our intelligence agencies has been confirmed to have interfered in our election.Watch it below:Featured image via Getty Images\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n

Back in the day, Trump was known for calling reporters all over the New York area pretending to be his own publicist. He would call, not to tout his business successes but to brag about his sex life.The sketch also made fun of the relationship between the hosts. The pair got engaged recently when they were celebrating Mika s 50th birthday. The sketch shows the response from the other panelists on the show, Mark Halperin, Willie Geist and Mike Barnacle, who all have no idea how to respond to Joe and Mika s behavior on the set.Featured image via Frederick M.

In the aftermath of the disastrous Comey hearing where it was confirmed that The Donald s team was indeed being investigated   and of Rep. Nunes  decision to skip informing his fellow congressional Russia investigators of perfectly legal  incidental collection  of information about Trump associates and possibly the President* himself and run to The Donald with it instead   Trump has been flailing, attempting to distract from the whole Russia thing as much as possible.That s going to be very hard now, as U.S. officials have now confirmed that the facts suggest that members of his team were indeed working with the enemy. CNN reports:The FBI has information that indicates associates of President Donald Trump communicated with suspected Russian operatives to possibly coordinate the release of information damaging to Hillary Clinton s campaign, US officials told CNN.\",\n          \" Vladimir Putin Just Defended Trump In The WORST Way Possible (VIDEO) According to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, it s silly to worry about little things like whether or not a couple of Russian ladies peed on Donald Trump s bed because it s much, much worse to publish memos that reveal these allegations.Putin says that there is a conspiracy to  delegitimize  the man and his team of hackers, fake news writers, and trolls he worked hard to install in the Oval Office by hacking Trump s political opponents and running an aggressive propaganda campaign. I don t know Mr. Trump, I have never met him, I don t know what he will do in the international arena, so I have no reason either to attack him, criticize him or defend him, Putin said at a press conference. Donald Trump has been with the most beautiful women in the world, so why would he need prostitutes in Moscow? To answer that question, we need only look to a 2001 edition of the Howard Stern Show in which Trump was reminded that he bragged that he likes to go to Russia to have sex with women because they  have no morals. Putin says that Russian security services  do not chase every US billionaire,  and that the release of the documents was worse than prostitutes. In a way, he s right, as the documents presented to both Trump and President Obama also allege that members of the President-elect s campaign staff directly worked with the Russian government during the campaign.On numerous occasions, Trump has repeated Russian propaganda while attacking U.S. intelligence agencies that have been exposing him for what he is and, of course, has directly quoted Putin (a man whom Trump says is  very smart ) while hurling barbs at Hillary Clinton.Trump and Putin have been screaming about the  fake news  release of actual documents that actual intelligence agencies are in possession of, but the BBC reported recently that the whole pissing Russian ladies thing is just the tip of the iceberg. Correspondent Paul Wood revealed last week that at least four sources have confirmed the information, with one U.S. intelligence source informing him that there is audio and video of The Donald s escapades, and an Israeli news source reports that the country s spies have been warned against sharing information with the United States for fear that Trump will relay it to Putin.Putin and Trump s bromance is disconcerting at best   especially when more than a baker s dozen intelligence agencies have confirmed that the man who stood up to join Trump in his attacks on our intelligence agencies has been confirmed to have interfered in our election.Watch it below:Featured image via Getty Images\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Real\",\n          \"Fake\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labe_num\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label_num\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"preprocessed_txt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9865,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"  ICYMI SNL Skewers Morning Joe Hilarious week s cold open Saturday Night Live feature parody morning Morning Joe sketch feature Alex Moffat host Joe Scarborough Kate McKinnon Mika Mika Brzezinski sketch Alec Baldwin President Donald Trump call   John Miller   spokesperson White House day Trump know call reporter New York area pretend publicist tout business success brag sex life sketch fun relationship host pair get engage recently celebrate Mika s 50th birthday sketch show response panelist Mark Halperin Willie Geist Mike Barnacle idea respond Joe Mika s behavior set feature image Frederick M.

Final Observations**\n","* As machine learning algorithms do not work on text data directly, we need to convert them into numeric vectors and feed that into models while training.\n","\n","* In this process, we convert text into a very high dimensional numeric vector using the technique of Bag of words and we use sklearn CountVectorizer for this.\n","\n","**Without Pre-Processing Data**\n","\n","* From the above in most of the cases, we can see that when we have the count vectorizer above trigrams or at trigrams, the performance keeps degrading. The major possible reason for this as the ngram_range keeps increasing, the number of dimensions/features (possible combination of words) also increases enormously and models have the risk of overfitting and resulting in terrible performance.\n","\n","* For this reason, models like KNN failed terribly when performed with trigrams and using the euclidean distance. K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN) doesn't work well with high-dimensional data because, with a large number of dimensions, it becomes difficult for the algorithm to calculate the distance in each dimension. In higher dimensional space, the cost to calculate distance becomes expensive and hence impacts the performance of the model. It performed well for class 1 and had terrible results for Class 0.\n","\n","* Both recall and F1 scores increase better when trained with the same KNN model but with cosine distance as cosine distance does not get influenced by the number of dimensions as it uses the angle better the two text vectors to calculate the similarity.\n","\n","* With respect to Naive and RandomForest models, both performed really well, and random forest with trigrams has a better edge on the recall metric.\n","\n","* As Random Forest uses Bootstrapping(row and column Sampling) with many decision trees and overcomes the high variance and overfitting of high dimensional data and also uses feature importance of words for better classifying the categories.\n","\n","* The easy calculation of probabilities for the words in the corpus(Bag of words) and storing them in a contingency table is the major reason for the Multinomial NaiveBayes to be a text classification friendly algorithm.\n","\n","**With Pre-Processing Data**\n","\n","* Have trained the best model RandomForest on the pre-processed data, but RandomForest with trigrams fails to produce the same results here.\n","\n","* But the same randomForest with Unigram to Trigram features helps to produce very amazing results and is tops in the entire list with very good F1 scores and Recall scores.\n","\n","**Machine Learning is like a trial and error scientific method, where we keep trying all the possible algorithms we have and select the one which gives good results and satisfies the requirements like latency, interpretability, etc.**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"rcuCEmWaSszb"},"source":["## [**Solution**](./bag_of_n_grams_exercise_solutions.ipynb)"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
